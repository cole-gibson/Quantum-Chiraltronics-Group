This code calculates the topological charge for discrete 2D lattice of spins [1]. For 3D systems, one defines a slice of the system for the calculation. Sublattices can be specified so that the charge can be calculated in a per-sublattice basis. An array - "defect" - holds the values indicative of a topological defect [1] that the user may inspect.

Output includes each sublattice winding, the total winding summed over sublattices, and the creation of a "charge.png" that visualizes contributions of each pair of 3-spins to the charge.
